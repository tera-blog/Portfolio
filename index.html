        <p>Hello! My name is Athirah. I am passionate about learning graphic design, multimedia development and I enjoy creating simple web pages like this one. I love exploring new technologies and sharing my journey with others. Also, I really enjoy taking photos that I find beautiful to look at, especially the sky and the moon.</p>

    <!-- My Journey Section -->
    <section id="blog" class="section">
        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>My educational journey began when I pursued a diploma in Information Technology (Multimedia) at Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I completed my entire diploma through online learning. Although it was challenging to adapt to fully virtual classes, the experience taught me to be independent, disciplined, and resilient.</p>
        <p>One of the most memorable parts of my diploma was working on my final year project, where I gained valuable hands-on experience and improved my problem-solving skills.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am furthering my studies at the degree level, majoring in Information Technology (Informatics Media). Throughout this journey, I’ve developed a deep interest in creative work, especially in graphic and multimedia design.</p>
        <p>In addition, I am highly interested in Virtual Reality (VR) technology as I believe it has the potential to create immersive and impactful user experiences. I am excited to explore how VR can be integrated into multimedia design to bring ideas to life in more interactive ways.</p>
        <p>In the future, I aspire to build a career that aligns with my passion—working as a graphic and multimedia designer while continuously exploring new technologies like VR to enhance the creative industry.</p>
