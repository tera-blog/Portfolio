        <p>Hello! My name is Athirah. I am passionate about learning graphic design, multimedia development and I enjoy creating simple web pages like this one. I love exploring new technologies and sharing my journey with others.
            Also, I really enjoy taking photos that I find beautiful to look at, especially the sky and the moon.</p>

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>My educational journey began when I pursued a diploma in Information Technology (Multimedia) at Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I completed my entire diploma through online learning. Although it was challenging to adapt to fully virtual classes, the experience taught me to be independent, disciplined, and resilient.
           One of the most memorable parts of my diploma was working on my final year project, where I gained valuable hands-on experience and improved my problem-solving skills.
           Currently, I am furthering my studies at the degree level, majoring in Information Technology (Informatics Media). Throughout this journey, I’ve developed a deep interest in creative work, especially in graphic and multimedia design.
           In addition, I am highly interested in Virtual Reality (VR) technology as I believe it has the potential to create immersive and impactful user experiences. I am excited to explore how VR can be integrated into multimedia design to bring ideas to life in more interactive ways.
           In the future, I aspire to build a career that aligns with my passion—working as a graphic and multimedia designer while continuously exploring new technologies like VR to enhance the creative industry.</p>
        <p>I started learning programming because I believe that technology can make life better. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm excited to continue improving my skills.</p>
